/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Thought Process:
 * 1. **Understanding the Problem:**
 *    - The grid consists of **'1' (land)** and **'0' (water)**.
 *    - An **island** is a group of connected '1's (connected in 4 directions: up, down, left, right).
 *    - Our goal is to **count the number of islands** in the grid.
 *
 * 2. **Key Observations:**
 *    - If we find a '1' that is **not visited**, it must be part of a new island.
 *    - We should **traverse and mark all connected lands ('1's)** as visited.
 *    - We can use **DFS (Depth First Search)** to explore each island.
 *
 * 3. **Optimized Approach (DFS Traversal):**
 *    - **Iterate through the grid** to find **unvisited '1's**.
 *    - When a new '1' is found:
 *      - **Increase the island count**.
 *      - **Use DFS to mark all connected lands ('1's) as visited**.
 *    - Continue scanning the grid until all islands are counted.
 */

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Intuition:
 * 1. If a cell contains '1' (land) and has not been visited, it is **part of a new island**.
 * 2. Once we identify an island, we **explore all connected lands** using DFS to mark them as visited.
 * 3. Every time we start a DFS from an unvisited land cell, we **increase the island count**.
 * 4. The result is the total number of DFS calls that were triggered for new islands.
 */

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Approach:
 * 1. **Initialize a visited matrix** to track visited land cells.
 * 2. **Iterate through the entire grid**:
 *    - If a cell is **'1' and not visited**:
 *      - **Increase the island count**.
 *      - **Start DFS** from this cell to mark the entire island as visited.
 * 3. **DFS Traversal**:
 *    - Explore the **four possible directions** (up, down, left, right).
 *    - If the next cell is within bounds, unvisited, and contains '1', continue DFS.
 * 4. **Return the total number of islands** counted during traversal.
 */

/**
 * ðŸ”¹ Time Complexity: **O(m Ã— n)**
 *    - We visit each cell **at most once**.
 *    - DFS explores all connected lands efficiently.
 *
 * ðŸ”¹ Space Complexity: **O(m Ã— n)**
 *    - **Visited array** takes O(m Ã— n) space.
 *    - **Recursion stack** can go up to O(m Ã— n) in the worst case (entire grid is land).
